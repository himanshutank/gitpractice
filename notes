FAQ:

1. How to merge in a right way.

	git checkout master
	git pull
	git checkout <branch_name>
	git pull
	git rebase -i master
	git checkout master
	git merge

2. What does "git push origin master" means?

	This means push your local master branch to the master branch of the remote origin (origin/master)

	If you would have specified

	git push origin master:my_work

	then you would have pushed your local master to origin/my_work. If you don't use the :my_work part, then the destination defaults to the 
	same branch as given as source.

3. How to delete branch from remote?

	git push -d <remote_name> <branch_name>

4. How to search git logs
	
	git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

	git log -S <any_text_in_any_of_your_file>

5. What to try when you think you messed something up?

	git reflog 

	git clean

	git reset - - hard

	git push --force

6. .gitignore OR ./git/info/exclude

	Tip is to keep all the configs in .gitignore. This will not allow 'git clean' to delete important config files.

	Or keep config files outside of the repo.

7. gitconfig settings

	[log]
	date = relative

	[format]
	pretty = format:%h %Cblue%ad%Creset %ae %Cgreen%s%Creset

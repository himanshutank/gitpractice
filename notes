FAQ:

1. How to merge in a right way.

	git checkout master
	git pull
	git checkout <branch_name>
	git pull
	git rebase -i master
	git checkout master
	git merge

2. What does "git push origin master" means?

	This means push your local master branch to the master branch of the remote origin (origin/master)

	If you would have specified

	git push origin master:my_work

	then you would have pushed your local master to origin/my_work. If you don't use the :my_work part, then the destination defaults to the 
	same branch as given as source.

3. How to delete branch from remote?

	git push -d <remote_name> <branch_name>

FAQ:

1. How to merge in a right way.

	git checkout master
	git pull
	git checkout <branch_name>
	git pull
	git rebase -i master
	git checkout master
	git merge

2. What does "git push origin master" means?

	This means push your local master branch to the master branch of the remote origin (origin/master)

	If you would have specified

	git push origin master:my_work

	then you would have pushed your local master to origin/my_work. If you don't use the :my_work part, then the destination defaults to the 
	same branch as given as source.

3. How to delete branch from remote?

	git push -d <remote_name> <branch_name>

	#oneliner to delete all the remote branches that are merged into the remote master. 

	git push origin --delete $(git branch --merged origin/master -r | grep -v master | grep origin | cut -d/ -f2-)

	In order to do a dry, just run everything inside $()

4. How to search git logs
	
	git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

	git log -S <any_text_in_any_of_your_file>

	git blame -w <file_name>

5. What to try when you think you messed something up?

	git reflog 

	git clean

	git reset - - hard

	git push --force

6. .gitignore OR ./git/info/exclude
